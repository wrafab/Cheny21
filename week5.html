<h1>Week 5</h1>
  <h2> 3D Scanning and Printing </h2>
  <p> I kindly asked one of the students in the Digital Fabrication class to scan my face with a 3D scanner. Next, I imported the file into Meshmixer. I downloaded a set of HALO soldier 3-D models from Thingverse. Then, I chose one of the models and meshmixed my head with it. I exported it as a .stl file and imported it to makerbot. I printed out on the Makerbot 5th Gen 3D printer.</p>
  <br>
  <p> I also designed and 3D-printed a phone stand using the Autodesk Fusion 360.</p>
  <p> I first sketched and extruded the model. Next, I used the "fillet" function of the app to round the edge of the model to make it look better. Then, I put my name on the model and extruded it so that it would show on the actual product. I imported the .stl file to Makerbot and saved it as .makerbot file. Finally, I printed the model on the Makerbot 5th Gen 3D printer.</p>
