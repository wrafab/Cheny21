<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h2> Garment, Sublimation, and UV printing.<h2>
  <br>
  <p> For garment printing, I printed a t-shirt. First, I designed a Reserve Football-themed logo in GTX Graphics Lab and saved it as a GT3 print file in a USB drive. Next I ironed the t-shirt to make sure it doesn't have any wrinkles while being printed. Then I put my t-shirt on the GT-361 garment printer, plugged my USB onto the printer, selected the file and printed it. I ironed the t-shirt again to dry the ink.</p>
