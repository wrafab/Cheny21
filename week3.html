<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h2> Garment, Sublimation, and UV printing.<h2>
  <br>
  <p> For garment printing, I printed a t-shirt. First, I designed a Reserve Football-themed logo in GTX Graphics Lab and saved it as a GT3 print file in a USB drive. Next I ironed the t-shirt to make sure it doesn't have any wrinkles while being printed. Then I put my t-shirt on the GT-361 garment printer, plugged my USB onto the printer, selected the file and printed it. I ironed the t-shirt again to dry the ink.</p>

  <p> Here is my t-shirt.</p>

 <p> For sublimation printing, I printed a mug with a picture of NFL all-pro DT Aaron Donald on it. I first aquired the picture from Google image. Next, I put it in corel draw and modified its size to make sure that it would fit on the mug and mirrored the image so that it would look the same on the mug. Then I printed out the picture and taped it around the mug. Finally, I heat pressed it under 400 degrees for 1 minute 45 seconds and let the dye cool down in cold water. This is the process of Sublimation Dye Transfer.</p>
