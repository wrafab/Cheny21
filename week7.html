<h1> Week 7 </h1>
  <h2> Soldering and Electronics </h2>
  <p> On week 7, I used the DIY solderig kit to make a electronic clock. </p>
 <p>I heated the iron to 750 degrees and used lead-base solder to solder each electronic parts onto the board. When I was soldering, I made sure that the iron did not touch the electronics for more than two seconds so that it wouldn't overheat the board.</p>

  <p> I also used the Arduino electronics kit to do some fun electronic experiments. I damaged a few LEDs because I put them onto the breadboard without putting resistors on first. I learned that some LEDs cannot withstand a lot of electricity and need the help of resistors to function normally.</p>
  <p> Here are the pictures of the experiments that I did.</p>
