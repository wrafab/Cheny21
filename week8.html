<h1> Week 8 </h1>
  <h2> Sewing and Emboidery </h2>
<p> On week 8, I used the Tajima Sai, a commercial embrodiery machine, to sew a hat. I put the word "ICE" on the hat. Before sewing, I put backings both inside and outside the hat so that the machine has a place to pull its needles without damaging the hat itself. I put hard backings inside the hat; and soft backings outside the hat. The soft backing dissolves in water, so the outside of the hat would look perfectly clean and normal after I use water to wipe the soft backing off. I used the "Hoop Master" to fix the hat to make sure that it wouldn't get pulled around by the needle when the machine was sewing.</p>

<p> I also made a pillow case using three pieces of patterned clothes using the Viking Emrald 118 03 Sewer. First, I cut off pieces of different size from the clothes I chose and ironed them. I pinned them together and sewed them. Then I repeated the same process until all the edges were sewed together. Finally, I turned the pillow case inside out, ironed it, and sewed it one more time to ensure its durability.</p>
