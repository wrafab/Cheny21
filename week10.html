<h1> Week 10 </h1>
<h2> Final Project </h2>
<br>
<p> For Finial Project, I created a keychain holder using CAD, a.k.a. Computer-aided Design, and 3D printing.</p>
<br>
<p> The inspiration for this project was that I had a lot of keys back home. I often lost my keys. This inspired me to create a little object which I can stick on the wall to keep all my keys at one place.</p>

<p> However, as a boarder at Reserve I do not have a lot of keys with me, therefore, for a complete demonstration and utilization of this keychain holder, I made two graphic keychains using Coreldraw, which involved graphic design, as part of this project; I used sublimation dye transfer to print the graphs onto two semi-gloss white square keychains.</p>
<p> I designed a green and black logo in Coreldraw and I editted a picture of Aaron Donald, a defensive tackle for the LA Rams. I made both images' size 5"x5" so that they would fit the size of the semi-gloss keychain.</p>
<p> Then, I printed out both images on a sheet of paper, and I taped the blank keychains with the images.</p>
<p> I set the heat platen to 400 degrees and I pressed the keychains for 1 minute and 15 seconds. After heat-pressing the keychains, I let the dye cool down for about five minutes.</p>
<br>
  <p> Here is the final product of this project.</p>

 During the process of creating this project, I enhanced my knowledge on CAD. I became better at using Fusion 360 to design 3D models. I also had a chance to make keychains for the first time since I chose to sublimation-print a mug on week 3 instead of printing a keychians. More importantly, I learned how to find inspiration from inconveniences in life, and turn these inspiration into real objects that can help me with these inconvenience and make life easier for me.</p>
