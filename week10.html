<h1> Week 10 </h1>
<h2> Final Project </h2>
<br>
<p> For Finial Project, I created a keychain holder using CAD, a.k.a. Computer-aided Design, and 3D printing.</p>
<br>
<p> The inspiration for this project was that I had a lot of keys back home. I often lost my keys. This inspired me to create a little object which I can stick on the wall to keep all my keys at one place.</p>
<br>
<p> However, as a boarder at Reserve I do not have a lot of keys with me, therefore, for a complete demonstration and utilization of this keychain holder, I made two graphic keychains using Coreldraw, which involved graphic design, as part of this project; I used sublimation dye transfer to print the graphs onto two semi-gloss white square keychains.</p>
