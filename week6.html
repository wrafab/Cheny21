<h1> Week 6 </h1>
  <br>
  <p> On week 6, we made our own skateboards or long boards by vacuum forming pieces of wood. I cooperated with Bakari Steve and we made a skateboard together.</p>
 <br>
  <p> First, we used Titebond III glue to glue 7 pieces of wood together. Next, we put the board into the vacuum bag and vacuumed the air in the bag.</p>
