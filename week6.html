<h1> Week 6 </h1>
  <br>
  <p> On week 6, we made our own skateboards or long boards by vacuum forming pieces of wood. I cooperated with Bakari Steve and we made a skateboard together.</p>
 <br>
  <p> First, we used Titebond III glue to glue 7 pieces of wood together. Next, we vacumm-bagged our skateboard to shape it.</p>
  <p> Then we spray-painted the bottom of the skateboard and coated it with SPAR Urethane.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Subtractive Manufacturing--I also made a chocalate mold. I designed a 3D model in Coral Draw and I saved as a .stl file so that I could use it in the MDX40A. Then, I created the mold using the MDX40A. Finally, I got to put some chocalate into the mold. It tasted pretty good.</p>
